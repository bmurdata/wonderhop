## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
Using figma to create the wireframes increased the speed time of creation, and also being able to share it with groupmate to get feedback was helpful. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
Trying to keep the wireframes as straightforward as possible when sharing at least three pages for the web app, and not going overboard on the workflow process. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
I believe we will need additional support for the source of data, the time frame of making the UI look appealing, and the functionality of the weather chatbot.
