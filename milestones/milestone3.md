## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Learning to create and link a project board, activating issues. Also performing the work itself.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We laid the groundwork on paper and researchwise, but struggled with the code. As of now, we will prioritize code and execution.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Logins, search, and chatbot seem at most risk. Search and loginss will be bumped up if they remain so.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

API tools, chatbot support, and insight on modern methods to stay on track.
