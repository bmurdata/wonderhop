## About

### Description and Purpose

WonderHop is here to make vacation planning a breeze. Search for your next vacation spot, plan an iterinary, and get weather forecasts all in one place. Save your dream vacations for later, edit, and share them with friends and colleagues. WonderHop is your comprehensive search tool to travel and exploration.

Most travel websites cater to those who know where they are going, or want to go, and get them there cheaply and efficently. We want to focus on the exploration of travel, offering a go from interests to destination in no time at all.
### Inspiration

Sites such as Trello, WonderLog, and Trip Advisor. We like how they make finding vacation planning easier when you have a place in mind.
